                <p class="quote"> Fab Market wants to offer <b>good designs made to last </b>and therefore all products need to be approved and tested before going on sale. Products have to be fairly easy to fabricate and come with step by step assembly instructions. </p> 
                <p class="quote"> Designers and makers can present their creations to the Fab Market, and once they are approved, they are invited to their local FabShop for <b>prototyping and testing.</b> </p> 
                <p class="quote"> In exchange for excellence FabLab Barcelona will offer the creators <b> a special discount of fabrication</b> every time their product is sold. </p>
