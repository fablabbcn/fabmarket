Coming soon!

An innovative method to carry objects with a bike, easy to put up and take down. It is composed of an elasticized belt 4cmx500cm , and two pieces of methacrylate at the two extremes to secure it to the frame of the bike. The idea is to bring all objects that can not be taken on a bike, for example; umbrella, album design, baguettes, and especially the locker that no one ever knows where to put it. After the use, it is very easy to remove it and put it in a backpack, and takes up very little space.
