A multifunctional bag made to carry everything from a laptop to all your camping gear. The design of the pattern is simple and simetric so it can be cut in a laser-bed of 60 x90 cm. The bag can be made from one single piece of almost any textile, which makes it easy to assemble. Eliminating weight-carrying seams gives it more durability and longer life expectancy. With any wood and textile Taska can be easily made in a local Lab.
