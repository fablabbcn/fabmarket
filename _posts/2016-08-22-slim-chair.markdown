Coming soon! 

The Slim Chair has been engineered to take the most from the structural features of plywood and combines high bending resistance with an extraordinary low weight. Made using standard 18mm plywood, the Slim Chair is very easy to fabricate and with a very simple assembly process. Once mounted the result is industrial-strength like and, even due to it’s apparent lightness, can withstand heavy loads. Not only that, you can fit three Slim Chairs onto a standard sheet of plywood which allows cost savings at the material level.
