A bluetooth portable sound system, handcrafted with selective materials, built into vintage objects (luggages, cases, furniture…) powered with high quality amplifiers and drivers. They are portable, rechargeable, just plug or pair – with bluetooth – your phone or laptop, and you will be ready to party anywhere, anytime!
